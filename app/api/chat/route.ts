  // College essay advice
  if (message.includes('essay') || message.includes('personal statement')) {
    return `# ‚úçÔ∏è **Crafting an Outstanding College Essay**

Your college essay is your chance to show admissions officers who you are beyond grades and test scores. Here's how to write a standout essay:

## **üéØ What Makes a Great College Essay?**

**The essay should be:**
- ‚úÖ **Authentic** - Genuine voice, not what you think they want
- ‚úÖ **Specific** - Concrete details, not generic statements
- ‚úÖ **Revealing** - Shows your character, values, and growth
- ‚úÖ **Engaging** - Hooks reader from the first sentence
- ‚úÖ **Well-written** - Clear, concise, error-free

## **üìù Common App Essay Prompts (Choose 1)**

1. **Background/Identity** - Story central to your identity
2. **Learning from Challenge** - Obstacle you overcame
3. **Questioning a Belief** - When you challenged an idea
4. **Gratitude Moment** - Problem you've solved or want to solve
5. **Accomplishment/Event** - Transition from childhood to adulthood
6. **Engaging Topic** - Something that makes you lose track of time
7. **Any Topic** - Your choice

## **üö´ Common Pitfalls to AVOID**

**DON'T:**
- ‚ùå Write what you think they want to hear
- ‚ùå Try to fit your entire life story in 650 words
- ‚ùå Use clich√©s ("I learned so much from this experience...")
- ‚ùå Write about something too generic (sports injury, mission trip)
- ‚ùå Focus only on the problem, not growth
- ‚ùå Use vocabulary you'd never say out loud
- ‚ùå Submit without proofreading (typos = rejected!)

## **‚úÖ Essay Topics That Work**

**Strong Topics:**
- A quirky hobby that reveals your personality
- Small moment that sparked big change
- Cultural tradition that shaped your values
- Overcoming a personal challenge with specific details
- Intellectual curiosity (a question you're obsessed with)
- Relationship that changed your perspective
- Creative project or passion

**Example: Instead of "My mission trip to Guatemala changed my life"**  
**Try:** "The moment I realized my privilege was when 8-year-old Maria asked if she could keep the pencil I handed her..."

## **üìê Essay Structure**

**Opening (Hook - 50-100 words):**
- Start with action, dialogue, or vivid scene
- Make admissions officers want to keep reading
- Avoid: "I have always wanted to..." or "Ever since I was young..."

**Body (Development - 400-500 words):**
- Use specific examples and anecdotes
- Show, don't tell (use sensory details)
- Reveal your thought process
- Demonstrate growth and reflection

**Conclusion (50-100 words):**
- Connect back to opening
- Show insight and maturity
- Look forward, not just backward
- Avoid: summarizing what you already said

## **‚ú® The "Show, Don't Tell" Rule**

**TELL (Weak):** "I am a hard worker and very determined."

**SHOW (Strong):** "At 4 AM, while my teammates slept, I analyzed game footage frame-by-frame, searching for the pattern in our opponent's defense. Three consecutive state championships later, those pre-dawn sessions were worth every lost hour of sleep."

## **üîß Revision Process**

**Draft 1:** Just write. Get your ideas on paper. Don't edit yet.

**Draft 2-5:** 
- Cut unnecessary words (aim for 600-650 words)
- Replace weak verbs with strong ones
- Add sensory details
- Check: Does this show who I am?

**Draft 6+:**
- Read aloud (awkward = needs fixing)
- Get feedback from teacher or counselor
- Check grammar & spelling
- Ensure it sounds like YOU

## **üí° Pro Tips**

1. **Start with a story, not a statement**
   - Good: "The flour explosion covered my face, my apron, and somehow, the ceiling."
   - Bad: "Baking has always been my passion."

2. **Use dialogue** to bring scenes to life

3. **Be vulnerable** - admissions officers value authenticity

4. **The mundane can be magical** - everyday moments reveal character

5. **Your essay should pass the "swap test"** - could only YOU have written this?

## **üìÖ Timeline**

- **Summer before senior year:** Brainstorm & draft
- **August-September:** Write & revise
- **October:** Finalize with feedback
- **November:** Submit with EA/ED apps

## **üéì Supplemental Essays ("Why This College?")**

**Answer these questions:**
- Why this specific school? (Be specific!)
- What will you contribute?
- What specific programs/professors/opportunities excite you?

**DO YOUR RESEARCH:**
- Mention specific classes, professors, programs
- Show you've visited (in-person or virtually)
- Explain fit, not just prestige

## **‚úçÔ∏è Your Essay Checklist**

Before submitting, ask:
- ‚òëÔ∏è Does this sound like me talking?
- ‚òëÔ∏è Did I show, not tell?
- ‚òëÔ∏è Is there specific detail and reflection?
- ‚òëÔ∏è Does it reveal something meaningful about me?
- ‚òëÔ∏è Is every word earning its place?
- ‚òëÔ∏è Have I proofread multiple times?
- ‚òëÔ∏è Did someone else review it?

**Remember: Your essay is your voice. Make it authentic, specific, and memorable. Good luck! üöÄ**`;

## **üí∞ Financial Aid Comparison Tool**

For each school, calculate:

- Minus: Work-study
- = **Net Price** (what you'll pay per year)
- √ó 4 years = **Total Cost**
- Consider: Loan amounts & interest

**Choose the school with best value, not lowest sticker price!**

> **"The best college is the one where YOU will thrive - academically, socially, and financially."**

- There's no single "perfect" school
- Prestige ‚â† Happiness
- You can succeed from ANY college with effort

1. **Apply to MANY** - scholarship hunting is a numbers game
2. **Start with local** - less competition, better odds
3. **Meet every deadline** - set reminders!
4. **Keep a master file** - common essay, resume, transcript

## **üéì Negotiating Financial Aid**

**Yes, you can negotiate!**

**When to appeal:**

**How to appeal:**
1. Call the financial aid office
2. Be polite and professional
3. Provide documentation
4. Explain your situation clearly
5. Follow up in writing

**Script:** "I'm thrilled about my acceptance, but the aid package doesn't make attendance possible for my family. I have a better offer from [peer school]. Is there any additional aid available?"
