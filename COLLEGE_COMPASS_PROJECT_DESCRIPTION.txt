                    Project Description & Pitch Deck
===============================================================================


EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
===============================================================================

College Compass is an AI-powered web application that transforms the 
overwhelming college planning process into a personalized, step-by-step 
journey. Combining intelligent automation with comprehensive resources, 
College Compass serves as the ultimate companion for high school students 
navigating their path to higher education.


THE PROBLEM
===============================================================================

Every year, 3.7+ million U.S. high school students face the daunting college 
application process:

* INFORMATION OVERLOAD: 4,000+ colleges, countless majors, and constantly 
  changing requirements

* TIMELINE CONFUSION: Students miss critical deadlines costing them thousands 
  in scholarships

* ESSAY ANXIETY: 650-word personal statements with 7+ Common App prompts to 
  choose from

* PLANNING PARALYSIS: Uncertainty about which courses to take each year for 
  target colleges

* EXPENSIVE CONSULTANTS: Private college counselors cost $4,000-$10,000+ 
  per student

RESULT: 40% of students apply to schools misaligned with their goals, and 
billions in scholarship money goes unclaimed.
