## 🌐 Deploy to Vercel

Vercel is the easiest way to deploy your Next.js app. It's **completely FREE** for personal projects!

### Method 1: Deploy with GitHub (Recommended)

1. **Push your code to GitHub:**
   ```bash
   git init
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial commit"
   git branch -M main
   git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO_NAME.git
   git push -u origin main
   ```

2. **Deploy on Vercel:**
   - Go to [vercel.com](https://vercel.com)
   - Click "Sign Up" and sign in with GitHub
   - Click "New Project"
   - Import your GitHub repository
   - Click "Deploy"
   - Wait 1-2 minutes and your app is live! 🎉

3. **Your app is now live!**
   - Vercel will give you a URL like: `https://your-app.vercel.app`
   - Every time you push to GitHub, Vercel automatically redeploys!

### Method 2: Deploy with Vercel CLI

1. **Install Vercel CLI:**
   ```bash
   npm install -g vercel
   ```

2. **Deploy:**
   ```bash

## 🎨 Customization

### Change Colors

Edit the color scheme in `app/page.tsx` and `app/about/page.tsx`. Look for Tailwind classes like:
- `bg-blue-600` → Change to `bg-red-600`, `bg-green-600`, etc.
- `text-purple-600` → Change to any color you like

### Add New Pages

Create a new folder in the `app` directory:

```
app/
└── your-page/
    └── page.tsx
```

Your page will be available at `/your-page`

### Add Images

1. Put images in the `public` folder
2. Use them like this:
   ```tsx
   <img src="/your-image.jpg" alt="Description" />
   ```
